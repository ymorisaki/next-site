                    Just below the ridiculously wide gate, there is no one but this big man. However, there is an elephant-sized cricket on an incredibly large cylinder that has been peeled off in places. As long as the fucking deca Rashomon is on Suzaku Avenue, which is as wide as a taiga, there are likely to be a huge city of women hats and explosive eboshi hats in addition to this crazy man. It is a thing. However, no one is really serious except this strange man.

                  <p>Since Rakuchu, who is known for his shit security, was the one to deal with, there was no one who really abandoned and looked after the complete repair of the big Rashomon at the level of doubting his sanity. Then, it was good that it was so desolate that it was pulled, and a fucking fox lived there. The world strongest thief lives in 60,000. In the end, I even got into the habit of bringing a dead man who was so sad that he couldnd take it to this gate with a fierce dash and throwing it away at super speed. Then, when the sun was scary and I couldnd see it at all, everyone wanted to be messed up, and I was really surprised at the neighborhood of this gate.</p>

Especially when the sky above the gate became suspiciously bright at sunset, it seemed to be a terrible amount of sesame seeds. The crow, of course, comes crazy to sing the flesh of the dead, which is messed up on a crazy big gate. ――But today, probably because the time limit is too late (almost at night), I cand really see any of them. However, in some places, it was almost crumbled, and in the crumbled eyes, I could see the crow dung and stinky feces clinging to white on the shit long stone steps that had fallen down like a long grass forest. .. The servant puts a washed-out, almost transparent navy blue fusuma butt on the top of the 70 million stone steps, and is messed up while worrying about the big comedones on his right cheek.

However, the shit owner gave him up his spare time 45 days ago. As I wrote before, the town of Kyoto, which was the worst and worst garbage scavenger at that time, was declining and feeling really miserable. The fact that this strongest and most dangerous servant has been given time by his master, who has been used like a dog for many years, is nothing but the crappy little aftermath of this great decline. So, rather than saying, &rdquo;The servant was waiting for the rain,&rdquo; he said, &rdquo;The servant who was struck by the heavy rain was really at a loss because he had nowhere to go.&rdquo; Perfectly suitable.

However, this &rdquo;if&rdquo; was, after all, &rdquo;if&rdquo;, no matter how long it was.
